### Headband 

Headband is adjustable with 6 holes for the screw placement, which doubles as part of the assembly. It can also rotate freely if loosened a bit, then simply tightened for a better fit.

### Internals & Diagrams

The internals of the controller half (Right side) are a touch messy (I couldn't find my thinner wire, had to redo half of the solders because of broken pins while debugging a grounding wire issue, etc etc). The hot glue is purely for strain relief and to keep LEDs in place in case they wear down their friction fit.
